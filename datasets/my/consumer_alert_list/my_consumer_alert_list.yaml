  From the Bank Negara Malaysia website:

  > The Financial Consumer Alert List (FCA List) is a guide to enhance the
  > awareness on entities or schemes which may have been wrongly perceived
  > or represented as being licensed or regulated by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).  
  >
  > The FCA List is updated based on information received by BNM from members of
  > the public, after conducting necessary assessments on the reported entities
  > and schemes. Consumers may refer to the FCA List as one of several ways to
  > check if an entity or a scheme has been identified as one that has not been
  > authorised by BNM to offer financial products or services that are regulated
  > by BNM.
  >
  > The absence or subsequent removal of an entity or a scheme from the FCA List
  > however should not be construed as confirmation that such entity or scheme is
  > or has been licensed or regulated by BNM. As with any financial investment,
  > consumers are advised to exercise due care when investing in any entity or
  > financial scheme.
