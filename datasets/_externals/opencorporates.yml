  The largest open database of company data in the world, with data from over 140 registries.
description: |
  OpenCorporates is a global database of companies, their directors and regulatory filings.

  We provide links to OpenCorporates for entities that exist both in our database and in the
  OpenCorporates database. These links can be used to explore more detail about sanctioned
  companies. OpenCorporates customers with bulk data or API access can also use the
  OpenCorporates URL to integrate both datasets, for example to build an in-house knowledge
  graph with sanctions and company control information.

  **Note:** as of May 2022, we have only linked some sanctioned companies to OpenCorporates.
  In the future, we also hope to create links regarding directors and beneficial owners of
  companies, for example in cases where the owner is a politicially exposed person (PEP).
